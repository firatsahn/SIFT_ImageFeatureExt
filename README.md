# Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)

A feature extraction and matching algorithm for computer vision and image processing

1 - Finding Feature Points : Detecting unique structures and patterns --> scale independence

2 - Feature Definition : A descriptor for each feature point --> uniqueness and difference

3 - Feature Matching : Matching similar feature points

4 - Scale Invariance: Objects can be found at different scales and rotation angles

5 - Stability of processing : Stability against illumination changes and noise in images

- Object Recognition, Object tracking
-  3D modelling, image matching
- Path detection and obstacle avoidance algorithms
